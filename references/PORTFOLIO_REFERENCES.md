- Smooth transitions between theme states
- Accessible toggle button with clear visual indicators

### 4. Animated Section Transitions
- Scroll-triggered animations for section reveals

- Staggered animations for list items
- Professionally restrained animation timing

## Animation Requirements

### Section Animations
- Smooth reveal on scroll for all major sections
- Staggered animations for list items
- Subtle transitions between states
- Support for reduced motion preferences
- Animations that enhance rather than distract

### Interaction Animations
- Hover effects for navigation links (underline animation)
- Card elevation on hover for project items
- Button state transitions for interactive elements
- Smooth page transitions between views
- Subtle feedback for interactive elements

## Technical Requirements

### Core Requirements
- Static site hosted on GitHub Pages
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Fast loading times with optimized assets
- SEO optimized with proper metadata
- Accessibility compliant for all users

### Performance Goals
- Lighthouse score > 90 for all categories
- First contentful paint < 1.5s
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Optimized assets (images, fonts)
- Minimal JavaScript bundle size

## Implementation Plan

### Selected Tech Stack: Next.js with Static Export

After evaluating various options including vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, Jekyll, 11ty, Astro, and SvelteKit, Next.js with static export has been selected as the optimal framework for this portfolio site for the following reasons:

1. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Static export generates plain HTML/CSS/JS files at build time
   - Expected bundle size for a portfolio: ~150-300KB total (including minimal React runtime)
   - First Contentful Paint target: 0.5-1.0 seconds
   - With proper optimization, performance is comparable to vanilla HTML/CSS/JS

2. **Component Architecture Benefits**:
   - Reusable components for project cards, experience items
   - Easier state management for theme switching
   - Better code organization and maintainability
   - Simpler updates when adding new content

3. **Animation Implementation**:
   - Integration with Framer Motion for complex animations
   - Easier implementation of filtering transitions
   - Scroll-triggered animations using Intersection Observer

4. **Future Expandability**:
   - Potential to add interactive project demos through API routes
   - Capability to add contact form processing if needed
   - Option to expand with dynamic content in the future

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Initialize Next.js project
- Configure for static export
- Set up GitHub repository
- Configure basic project structure

#### Phase 2: Core Components
- Layout and navigation components
- Theme switching implementation
- Basic section components

#### Phase 3: Feature Implementation
- Experience timeline with animations
- Project section with filtering
- Contact section with social links
- About section with professional information

#### Phase 4: Creative Section
- Photography gallery
- Blog post previews
- Personal projects showcase

#### Phase 5: Optimization
- Image optimization
- Performance tuning
- Accessibility improvements
- SEO optimization

#### Phase 6: Deployment
- GitHub Actions setup for automatic deployment
- Testing on GitHub Pages
- Custom domain configuration (if needed)

### Performance Optimization Strategies

To ensure the Next.js implementation meets performance goals:

1. **Image Optimization**:
   - Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Use appropriate image formats (WebP with fallbacks)

2. **JavaScript Optimization**:
   - Implement code splitting
   - Only import necessary parts of libraries
   - Use dynamic imports for non-critical components

3. **CSS Optimization**:
   - Consider utility-first CSS approach
   - Minimize unused CSS
   - Use CSS variables for theming

4. **Loading Performance**:
   - Implement proper font loading strategies
   - Minimize main thread work
   - Prioritize critical rendering path

### Potential Future Enhancements

While not planned for initial implementation, Next.js provides capabilities for:

1. **Interactive Project Demos**:
   - API routes to process user inputs
   - Server-side execution of project functionality
   - Interactive interfaces for visitors to engage with your work

2. **Additional Backend Features**:
   - Contact form processing
   - View/visit analytics
   - Dynamic content updates

These capabilities represent future expansion opportunities rather than initial requirements.

## Implementation Notes

- Use Intersection Observer API for performance-optimized scroll animations
- Implement prefers-reduced-motion media query support for accessibility
- Keep animations subtle and professional, not distracting
- Use CSS variables for consistent theming across components
- Optimize image assets with Next.js Image component
- Ensure accessibility features are implemented (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Implement responsive design patterns that work across all devices
