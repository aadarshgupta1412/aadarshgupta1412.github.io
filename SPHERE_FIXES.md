# Sphere Visibility & Color Fixes

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Sphere Appearing on All Pages** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- Sphere was using `fixed` positioning with `inset-0`
- This made it appear globally across ALL pages (Home, Projects, About, Contact)
- It was essentially a global background element

**Root Cause:**
```tsx
// BEFORE (WRONG):
<div className="fixed inset-0 pointer-events-none">
  <canvas />
</div>
```

**Fix Applied:**
```tsx
// AFTER (CORRECT):
<div className="absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none">
  <canvas />
</div>
```

**Why This Works:**
- `absolute` positioning makes the sphere contained within its parent
- Parent is `HeroSection` with `relative` positioning
- `HeroSection` is only used in `app/page.tsx` (homepage)
- When you navigate to other pages, the entire HeroSection unmounts
- Sphere unmounts with it ✅

### 2. **Text Visibility Issues - Colors Too Bright** ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
- Sphere was too bright/opaque
- Light blue/white colors were overwhelming the text
- Text on landing page was hard to read

**Changes Made:**

#### A. Reduced Sphere Opacity
```glsl
// BEFORE:
vec4 diffuseColor = vec4(cos(finalColors * noise * 3.0), opacity);

// AFTER:
vec4 diffuseColor = vec4(cos(finalColors * noise * 3.0), 0.3);
```
- Hardcoded opacity to 0.3 (30%) instead of full opacity
- Makes sphere much more subtle

#### B. Reduced Light Intensity
```typescript
// BEFORE:
const dirLight = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, isDark ? 2.0 : 1.8);
const ambientLight = new AmbientLight(0xffffff, isDark ? 0.4 : 2.7);

// AFTER:
const dirLight = new DirectionalLight(0xffffff, isDark ? 0.8 : 0.6);
const ambientLight = new AmbientLight(0xffffff, isDark ? 0.3 : 0.4);
```

**Intensity Comparison:**
| Mode  | Light Type | Before | After | Reduction |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Dark  | Directional | 2.0 | 0.8 | 60% |
| Dark  | Ambient | 0.4 | 0.3 | 25% |
| Light | Directional | 1.8 | 0.6 | 67% |
| Light | Ambient | 2.7 | 0.4 | 85% |

**Result:**
- Much more subtle sphere
- Text is clearly visible
- Sphere acts as background element, not focal point
- Better contrast throughout

### 3. **Smooth Page Transitions** ✅

**How It Works Now:**

#### Navigation Flow:
```
Homepage (/) → Projects (/projects)
└─ HeroSection unmounts
   └─ DisplacementSphere unmounts
      └─ Cleanup runs:
         - Canvas cleared
         - Geometry disposed
         - Material disposed  
         - Renderer disposed
         - Event listeners removed
```

#### Route-Based Behavior:

**Homepage (`/`):**
```
✅ HeroSection renders
└─ DisplacementSphere loads (lazy)
   └─ Fades in over 3 seconds
      └─ Stays visible while on homepage
```

**Other Pages (`/projects`, `/about`, `/contact`):**
```
✅ HeroSection does NOT render
└─ DisplacementSphere does NOT load
   └─ Clean page with no sphere
      └─ Only your content visible
```

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Component Hierarchy:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx
│   └── ClientLayout (nav + theme)
│
├── page.tsx (HOMEPAGE ONLY)
│   └── HeroSection
│       └── DisplacementSphere ✅
│
├── projects/page.tsx
│   └── (your content, NO sphere) ✅
│
├── about/page.tsx
│   └── (your content, NO sphere) ✅
│
└── contact/page.tsx
    └── (your content, NO sphere) ✅
```

### Positioning Context:

```tsx
// HeroSection (components/HeroSection.tsx)
<section className="relative min-h-screen ...">
  {/* ↑ relative = positioning context */}
  
  <DisplacementSphere />
  {/* ↑ absolute = contained within section */}
  
  <div className="relative z-10">
    {/* ↑ z-10 = above sphere */}
    Your content (text, buttons, etc.)
  </div>
</section>
```

## 🎨 Visual Design Now

### Opacity Levels:
- **Sphere**: 30% opacity (0.3)
- **Text**: 100% opacity
- **Result**: Clear, readable text with subtle animated background

### Color Behavior:

**Dark Mode:**
- Sphere: Subtle animated mesh with low-intensity lighting
- Text: Bright (#e4e4e7) stands out clearly
- Primary: Cyan (#00e5cc)
- Accent: Light blue (#5f9df7)

**Light Mode:**
- Sphere: Very subtle with minimal lighting
- Text: Dark (#111) stands out clearly
- Primary: Blue (#0070f3)
- Accent: Cyan (#00a8e8)

## ✅ What to Expect Now

### Homepage Behavior:
1. **Page loads** → Sphere starts loading (lazy)
2. **Sphere appears** → Fades in over 3 seconds (subtle, 30% opacity)
3. **Mouse movement** → Sphere rotates smoothly
4. **Scroll down** → Sphere stays with hero section
5. **Navigate away** → Sphere unmounts cleanly

### Other Pages:
1. **Navigate to Projects/About/Contact**
2. **NO sphere appears**
3. **Clean, distraction-free content**
4. **Nav and theme toggle still work**

### Transitions:
- **Home → Projects**: Sphere fades out naturally with page transition
- **Projects → Home**: Sphere fades in when hero section mounts
- **Smooth, React-based unmounting** (no flash or glitch)

## 🎯 Verification Checklist

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and verify:

### Homepage (`/`):
- [ ] Sphere appears in background (subtle, not overwhelming)
- [ ] Text is clearly readable
- [ ] Name decoder animation visible
- [ ] Rotating disciplines visible
- [ ] Mouse movement makes sphere rotate
- [ ] Sphere stays within hero section

### Projects Page (`/projects`):
- [ ] NO sphere visible
- [ ] Clean page with just content
- [ ] Nav and theme toggle work

### About Page (`/about`):
- [ ] NO sphere visible  
- [ ] Clean page with just content
- [ ] Nav and theme toggle work

### Contact Page (`/contact`):
- [ ] NO sphere visible
- [ ] Clean page with just content
- [ ] Nav and theme toggle work

### Navigation:
- [ ] Home → Projects: Smooth transition, sphere disappears
- [ ] Projects → Home: Sphere appears with fade-in
- [ ] No flickering or visual glitches
- [ ] No console errors

---

## 🔍 Debugging If Issues Persist

### If sphere still appears on all pages:
```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next
pnpm dev
```

### If text still hard to read:
- Check the opacity value in fragment shader (should be 0.3)
- Check light intensity values (should be 0.8/0.6 and 0.3/0.4)

### If sphere doesn't fade in:
- Check console for Three.js errors
- Verify WebGL is supported in your browser
